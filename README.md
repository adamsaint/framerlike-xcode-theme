## Preamble

I spend a lot of time in Xcode, and I missed the [Framer Syntax](https://github.com/framer/syntax) theme that I've been using in VSCode for the last couple of years, so I adapted a version of it I enjoy using for Xcode. My adaptation is primarily tuned for working with SwiftUI Views, but it seems reasonable for use in most Swift files. I still can't believe that you can't target operator tokens with custom colors in Xcode, but maybe I'm missing something. Enjoy!

## Installation

1. Using Finder or Terminal, navigate to: `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes`
2. Copy in the `Framerlike.xccolortheme` file.
3. Framerlike should now be available as a theme in your Xcode preferences.
